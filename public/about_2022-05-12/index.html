            <p>Hi all! Welcome to the blog!</p>
<p>First, a little about me: my name is Matt and I am a senior at New York University studying Computer Science. I'm originally from New Jersey, but upon graduating high school, I moved to NYC which is where I plan to hopefully stay in the future. Some things I enjoy doing in my freetime are playing videogames (like CSGO or League), eating ice cream, and working out so that I can eat ice cream. I'm also really starting to get into the custom mechanical keyboard scene (and I might make a post about one of my builds in the future).</p>
<p>In terms of technology, I really enjoy working on software and web development related projects. Most of my project ideas stem from discovering a cool technology online and wanting to put it in practice. In addition to this, I'm trying to delve deeper into the world of Machine Learning.</p>
<p>Now that you know a little more about me, let's get into what this blog is about. As of right now, I plan on making the topic on this blog really open-ended. It could be about something I find interesting, something I have been thinking about a lot recently, or possibly some technical guides like you would find on Medium. This is discussed more in depth in my <a href="https://matthewfan.io/first-post/">first blog post</a>, but I plan on using this platform to write about anything.</p>
<p>So hopefully you enjoy reading about what I have to say and sort of the journey I am taking. Here is my <a href="https://github.com/mattfan00">GitHub</a> if you want to take a look at some of the things I have been working on.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by and enjoy!</p>
<p>(<strong>P.S.</strong> I use a turtle icon as my website icon because I really liked turtles growing up. This great icon is provided by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik">Freepik</a> via <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/home">flaticon</a>)</p>
