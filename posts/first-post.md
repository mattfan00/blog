Hey everyone! 

Welcome to the first post of my blog. I've been meaning to create a blog for a while since I've enjoyed reading many other blogs, but I usually come to the conclusion that the things that I'm interested in writing about aren't interesting to others and eventually persuade myself not to. However, in order to create this blog, I forced myself to create my own static-site generator instead of using an existing one, which is hopefully enough push for me to take the initiative and start posting things, but I plan on touching on that later. 

For now, let's get into why I decided to create a blog.

### why?

There are two main resources that finally pushed me to create a blog.

The first resource is [Pine Wu's blog](https://blog.matsu.io/). If you take a look at his blog, you can see that a lot of the styling I used for my blog is inspired (stolen?) from his. I really enjoyed the visually pleasing minimalistic style that he incorporates, and I was inspired to use the same approach but with my own twist. More importantly though, I enjoyed reading the different topics that he touches upon, and it allowed me to gain more insight into his life outside of the work he does in his GitHub and I hope to do the same.

The second resource is one of my friends from college, Mark Bacon ([here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh7mi5sI3BSzKReLzXpgimA) is his YouTube channel). Mark's passion in making videos that he likes making definitely gave me the confidence to start writing about what I want to write about. The other day he was actually telling me about how he finds it awkward filming some of his videos, but is always surprised by great response that he gets back from the community. So even though it might feel embarassing putting yourself out there, it's only because you are perceive it that way while others may not. 

So after all that, I encourage whoever is reading this to go check them out and hopefully you enjoy viewing their content as much as I do!

### goals

So I don't plan on this blog being very structured. I want to be able to write about anything that comes to mind at anytime. So that means I don't want to stick to a planned schedule since that might cause this blog to feel like a chore. With that, I want to go into some of the goals I have with this blog. 

1. **Not sticking to specific topics.** As mentioned before, I want to be able to write about anything that comes to mind. Since I study Computer Science, there might be some code that I present, but my main objective is not to become a coding blog. I want to use this more as a way to just share any insights that I think about during the day and not lose them. 
1. **Improve writing skills.** This goal is inspired by Pine Wu's blog. I really liked reading what he had to say. I didn't think that by itself the things he talked about were very interesting, but I just liked hearing his take on it through his writing style. I hope that out of this blog, I come to enjoy writing more and become more well-rounded as a person. 
1. **Helping others.** I'm not too sure how many people would come across my blog since I don't think I would be advertising it at all. But I hope that if someone does come across it, they enjoy some of my ideas, even though I am young and don't know too much. 
1. **Reading this later.** Finally, I think it will be really cool if I could look back on this in the future!
